# Volume License Management Service

![Docker Tracker](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/theflightsims/vlmcsd)

**Volume License Management Service** is a free, open-source software to provide a volume-activation for Windows and Office products.

It is the replacement (or the solution for Linux) of [Key Management Services on Windows Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kms-activation-planning) (in term of operation), by provide less infrastructure compared to the Windows Server deployment (even the minimal one), or act as a backup solution in case the main Windows KMS Host fails.

### Build containers

To build, `Dockerfile` are provided in the `.docker` folder. Note that the multi-arch may need to include `--platform`. Currently, `vlmcsd` supports these following architecture

* `linux/amd64`
* `linux/arm64/v8`
* `linux/ppc64le`
* `linux/s390x`
* `linux/riscv64`

For example, the command below supports building `vlmcsd` for Linux running on AMD64

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f .docker/Dockerfile -t theflightsims/vlmcsd:linux-amd64 .
```

### With Visual Studio

Since this project is a part of [Windows Server Management Tool](https://github.com/TheFlightSims/windowsserver-mgmttools), you may need to clone the whole repository, before using Visual Studio.
